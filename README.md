# Claude Custom Instructions Collection

Welcome to my collection of custom instructions for Claude! This repository contains specialized instructions I've developed for use with Claude desktop. I'm sharing these instructions so others can benefit from them as well.

## What's In This Repository?

This repository contains custom instructions that can be used with Claude desktop to enhance its capabilities for specific tasks and workflows. Each instruction file is designed to be copied and pasted directly into Claude Projects.

## Requirements

To use these instructions, you'll need:

1. **Claude Desktop Application** - These instructions are designed specifically for use with the desktop version of Claude.
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** - Many instructions require specific MCP servers to be running. Each instruction file specifies which MCPs are needed.

## Available Instructions

- [News First Source](./News-First-Source.md) - A protocol for determining the earliest published source of a news story using Claude and MCP servers.

## How to Use These Instructions

1. Install Node.js on your system if you haven't already. Download and install the latest version from https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Install the Claude desktop application if you haven't already
3. Set up the required MCP servers mentioned in the specific instruction
4. Create a new Claude Project for the specific purpose (e.g., a "News Source Finder" project)
5. Open the instruction file you want to use in this repository
6. Copy the content from the code block section in the instruction file
7. Paste it into the Claude Project's custom instructions section
8. Start a conversation within that project referencing the instruction

Creating separate Claude Projects for each instruction type allows you to organize your work and maintain different specialized versions of Claude for different tasks.

## Ongoing Development

I'll be continuously improving these instructions and adding new ones as I develop better implementations and workflows. Feel free to check back for updates and improvements.

## Contribution

While this is primarily my personal collection, I welcome feedback and suggestions for improving these instructions. If you have ideas or have found ways to enhance these workflows, please open an issue to discuss.
